Except as noted below, Roy Soltoff and/or William Schroeder hold
copyright and/or distribution rights to the software and documentation
in this ZIP archive.  Roy Soltoff and William Schroeder each

This distribution is an exact image of the final version of LS-DOS
sold by Misosys, version 6.3, level 1H.

The Basic here is an enhanced version of Microsoft Model 4 Basic.  The
enhancements are provided under the copyright permission statement
above.  A complete Basic is provided instead of an enhancement patch
as a convenience to users.  The original Basic, copyright Microsoft,
is available on TRSDOS 6 disks from Tandy Software Replacement for $5,
and was also bundled with every Model 4.

The MODELA/III file here includes improved device driver and booting
code written and copyrighted by Frank Durda IV.  He has given
permission to retain that code in this free LS-DOS 6.3.1 distribution.
MODELA/III also includes Microsoft Model III Basic, and it may or may
not include portions of the Tandy device driver and booting code from
the original Tandy MODELA/III file.  Again, a complete MODELA/III file
is provided as a convenience to users.  The original Tandy version is
available on TRSDOS 6 (and several other) disks from Tandy Software
Replacement for $5, and was also bundled with every Model 4P.  A still
newer version of MODELA/III with further improvements is available for
sale from M.A.D. Software; contact Frank Durda IV for information.
